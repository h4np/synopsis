# Synopsis

### What?

Firefox extension which grabs captions from Youtube video with a click of a button, and generates bullet point summary with GPT-3.5-turbo model of OpenAI

### Why?

Because I want a quick sneak peek if that 10 minute content is worth going through or if it has any good points

### Sounds great! What do I need?

openAI API key and to download this firefox extension

Firefox: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/synopsiss/

### Setting up

Grab your API key from https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys , then set it in the extension options 

(right click extension logo -> manage extensions -> options tab -> copy paste the key in and press submit). 

After that you can go to any YouTube video with closed captions available and press the extension logo, which will then send everything to chatGPTs API endpoint and form a reply.
